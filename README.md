# WhoIsMimansa ðŸŒ¸

A personal introduction app being built with FlutterFlow.  
This project is currently in the **UI/Design phase** using FlutterFlowâ€™s visual builder.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Backup
This repo contains the project backup file:
- `WhoIsMimansa_backup.ymlas`

This file can be **re-imported into FlutterFlow** to restore the project setup.

## ðŸŽ¨ Features (Planned)
- Soft, welcoming introduction screen
- Flutter-based mobile-friendly design
- Full-stack integration in later phases
- Will include projects that I'm currently working on, I've laready finished, and competitions I participated in

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps
- Complete all app pages
- Export Flutter code once upgraded to Pro
- Integrate with Firebase and backend
- AI-based chatbot in future updates

## ðŸ“Œ Note
Code export is not available yet as it requires a Pro FlutterFlow plan. This repo is part of the documentation of my journey as an aspiring Full-stack AI/ML Engineer.
